1. Dependence of l1 and l2- When l1 and l2 are close then balancing is not robust, with swing-up(okay) but without swing-up(unstable)-----weird.
2. Impulse cannot work with second joint free.
3. We can lock second joint and then giving impulse might work, but angle between joints should be close to 180(>170 atleast).
